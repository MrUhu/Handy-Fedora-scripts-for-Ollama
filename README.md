## Overview
These scripts are designed to upgrade system packages, update Ollama, and configure AMD GPU memory settings for improved performance on local LLMs provided by Ollama.

***They are tested and used for Fedora Linux - please adjust for other distributions***

### What Each Script Accomplishes

#### `update.sh`

#### Description
When the ollama update is run, all set environment variables are deleted.
Also, the update script is rather dumb and always updates even if Ollama is up-to-date.
This script first runs a full system update and ensures everything is up an running on the Ollama side.

1. **System Package Updates**: 
   - Upgrades all installed packages using `dnf upgrade`
   - Updates all system packages with `dnf update -y`

2. **Ollama Version Management**:
   - Checks for latest Ollama version on GitHub
   - Compares current local version with latest release
   - If versions differ, downloads and installs the latest Ollama version

3. **GPU Configuration**:
   - Sets environment variable `HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=11.0.2` for Ollama service
   - Sets `OLLAMA_KV_CACHE_TYPE=q4_0` to optimize cache usage
   - Sets `OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL=3` to control parallelism if coding, embedding and autocompletion models are executed
   - Sets `OLLAMA_MAX_LOADED_MODELS=3` to limit loaded models
   - Reloads systemd configuration and restarts Ollama service

4. **Model Updates**:
   - Updates all installed Ollama models to their latest versions

#### `change_gtt_size_for_amd_igpu.sh`

#### Description
This script changes the size of the GTT memory assigned to the AMD iGPU, but limits the size to half of the available system memory.
If Ollama or AMD ROCm introduce no bugs that impacts memory handling - the available LLM memory will be vRAM+GTT.
Works with Ollama 0.12.6.

1. **GTT Memory Configuration**:
   - Calculates required GTT (Graphics Transfer Table) memory size based on user input
   - Checks current amdgpu memory configuration in dmesg output

2. **Parameter Adjustment**:
   - If GTT memory values don't match, updates kernel parameters with `amdttm.pages_limit` and `amdttm.page_pool_size`
   - Applies changes using `grubby` command

3. **Backup & Logging**:
   - Saves amdgpu memory dmesg output for backup
   - Provides detailed status information about configuration changes

4. **System Reboot**:
   - For the changes to take effect - the system will be rebooted

### `overwrite_gpu_restriction_to_modelfiles.sh`

#### Description
This script modifies Ollama model files to include a `num_gpu` parameter based on the layer count of each model.
Sometimes it is necessary to force Ollama to use the whole memory available to the iGPU (vRAM+GTT).
This script creates modelfiles for all models installed on the system and adds these models with a "my" prefix to Ollama.
May or may not work - use at your own risk.

1. **Directory Setup**:
   - Ensures a directory named `models` exists to store modelfiles.

2. **Model Processing**:
   - Retrieves the list of installed Ollama models.
   - For each model, it extracts the model name and generates a new model name with a `my` prefix.

3. **Modelfile Generation**:
   - For each model, it exports the modelfile using `ollama show`.
   - It then fetches information from the Ollama library to determine the layer count of the model.

4. **Parameter Injection**:
   - Removes the original `FROM` line from the modelfile.
   - Adds a new `FROM` statement to recreate the model.
   - Injects a `num_gpu` parameter into the modelfile, using the layer count.

5. **Model Recreation**:
   - Uses the modified modelfile to create a new model with the `num_gpu` restriction.
   - This allows better GPU memory management for models when running locally.

#### Important Notes
- These scripts were generated with the help of local AI (Qwen3-Coder 30b)
- These scripts were tested and will work on Fedora 42
- Usage at your own risk
- Requires root privileges to execute properly

### Usage
Run all scripts with appropriate permissions, e.g.:
```bash
chmod +x update.sh change_gtt_size_for_amd_igpu.sh
./update.sh
./change_gtt_size_for_amd_igpu.sh
```
